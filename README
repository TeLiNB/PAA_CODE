# BE-GA-GAN: A Unified Evolutionary GAN Framework for Cross-modal Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"BE-GA-GAN: A Unified Evolutionary GAN Framework for Cross-modal Anomaly Detection"**.

## Repository Structure

- **`BE-GA-GAN-IMAGE/`**:  
  Code for image anomaly detection on the **MVTec AD** dataset.

- **All other files and directories**:  
  Code for tabular anomaly detection experiments on the **UCI** datasets.

## Environment Requirements

All code has been tested and runs under the following environment:
- **Python 3.8**

Additional dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, NumPy, scikit-learn, etc.) are listed in the respective subdirectories or can be installed as specified in the instructions within each folder.

## Usage

Please refer to the README files inside the `BE-GA-GAN-IMAGE/` directory and the root folder for dataset preparation, training, and evaluation instructions specific to each setting.
